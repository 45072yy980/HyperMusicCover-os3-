/**
 * The element a pill or a disc wears the card's material on, keeping the outline it is given.
 *
 * The glass draws its rim along the element's own outline. NotificationUtil.applyElementViewBlend
 * starts with setRoundRect, which puts the notification card's corner on whatever view it is
 * handed - 24dp, 72px here - and the full-screen AOD's dim runs it on these views every frame
 * (MiniPlayerRuntime.dimView), with nothing putting ours back when the wake settles at the
 * card's own look. A 72px corner on a view whose frame is cut round at 81px has its rim cut off
 * toward the diagonals: thinner there, and the cut is the frame's outline clip, jagged (#7, #21).
 * So the outline is [shape], whoever sets it.
