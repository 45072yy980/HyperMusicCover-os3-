/**
 * Read-only probe: how the clock moves while the notification stack changes under it.
 *
 * The gesture this exists for is the island being pulled up into a media notification and
 * pushed back down: the clock gives way on the way up over a spring, and on the way back the
 * user sees it jump. Three different hands can be moving that clock - the OEM's own flow
 * pushing a new y, our rewrite of that y (roomForRows / easeRoom), and the OEM's own Folme
 * animation of the y it was given - and a settled reading cannot say which of them stepped.
 *
 * So this records BOTH sides of it, one line per drawn frame: what the y channel was told and
 * what we did with it, next to what the clock views were actually carrying on that frame. The
 * line that comes out is the one where `sz` or `clk` steps in a single frame while `req` ramps
 * - or where `req` steps and the drawn clock steps with it, which is the OEM and not us.
 *
 * Armed from adb, answered from adb; nothing here writes to any view:
 *
 *     am broadcast -a com.os4.musiccover.PROBE --es op clockmove --ei ms 10000
 *     ... do the pull up and the pull back down ...
 *     am broadcast -a com.os4.musiccover.PROBE --es op clockmove
 *
 * The recording stops by itself when the window runs out, and is kept until the next arming.
 * Rows of the answer, in the order they are printed:
 *
 *   t     ms since arming.  +k before a line = k identical frames before it (nothing moved).
 *   nY    setNotifY calls in THIS frame, req = the y the OEM put in, out = the y it left with.
 *   st    notifStateChange calls this frame, stY = its y, anim = its isDragOrFling flag
 *         (all_in_one goes through setNotifY instead, so this is normally absent).
 *   room  roomForRowsNow calls, top = stackContentTop, src = where that top came from.
 *   ease  the ease's own state: 1 = running, shown = the y it is showing, raw = the y asked
 *         for, jump = a jump was seen this frame (this is our hand, not the OEM's).
 *   sz    the last setSizeInternal the OEM asked a TimeView for - the font size, and the one
 *         number that is the OEM's animation progress rather than its target.
 *   ra    reassertClockRoom emissions this frame, @ = the y it emitted; raFail = it threw.
 *   cac   translation on `clock_animation_container`, which carries the clock and the date.
 *   clk   the clock target on screen: y / height / scaleY / translationY, per clock tree.
 *   date  the date's y on screen and its height.
 *   ph    ClockCollapse's phase, so a reading inside cover mode can be told from one outside.
