/**
 * The stack island's picture when its notifications are from more than one app: their pictures
 * together, newest first, laid out as a folder lays out its apps - two side by side, three two
 * over one, four and more two by two. The island shows its picture in a circle (see
 * pill-picture-circle-and-jaggies), so the layout is kept inside the circle the bounds hold.
 *
 * Copies of the pictures are drawn, not the notes' own: those are drawn elsewhere at their own
 * bounds, and a draw here would move them.
