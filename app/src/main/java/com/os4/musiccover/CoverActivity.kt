/**
 * The lock screen cover's settings, as a screen of its own.
 *
 * A screen rather than a page swapped in place, which is the same choice [LicenseActivity] makes
 * and for the same reason: a whole screen arriving is the platform's own transition, it brings
 * its own back handling - gesture, button and the predictive-back animation on Android 13+ - and
 * the sub-page inside FeaturesPage that this replaces had to imitate all three and matched none
 * of them.
 *
 * Nothing is passed in. Like the licence list, this reads the app's own settings itself, so the
 * caller only has to name the class.
